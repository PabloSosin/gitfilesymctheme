This is a repo I created to try out GitHub with a Windows client.
It is a replica of a customized WordPress theme created during YMC Session 7 Web Dev course.
Can be used to play around with it or delete without any side effects. 
The original un-modified version is in another Dropbox directory.

I have not been able to run the GitHub Windows client under Wine or Play on Linux.
I'm still looking for a suitable Linux gui.
